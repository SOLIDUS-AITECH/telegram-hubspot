## Important Points -

1. Telegram client connection is done using String Session instead of normal file session to store auth token of previously
authenticated session and save it as environment variables to use it for next authentication.

If not, It would verify using phone number which needs runtime input when deployed on cloud to give phone number as well as code generated 
for authentication.

2. May need to get the new session string by connecting locally and then using it on solidus to re deploy as it may expire after
some number of connections (maybe 20).

2. Need to give phone number, name, api id, api hash and session string of previously connected session of the telegram user to fetch
all the information for.
